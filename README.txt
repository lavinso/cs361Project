DESCRIPTION:
This is a fictional dog day care website developed for OSU CS361 Software Engineering I. The website was developed using
Agile Scrum framework and relies on a vaccine verification micro service provided by a classmate. The website
calls the microservice when a user logs into or loads their home page. The microservice evaluates the user's registered
dogs and sends a message back to the website stating whether or not the dogs will need a vaccination in the next 30
days, or are overdue. The website server reads that message and displays a corresponding alert for the user to see.

FUTURE WORK:
Implement a password reset feature
Connect contact us to an email
allow user to view and edit their profile, add billing, address, etc to profile
Add photos to dog profile, allow user to edit
allow two users for one dog (user1 and user2 foreign keys in dog table where user2 can be null)
currently no values are not null in the database. Also altered is string instead of boolean.
could make breeds a select, listing all dog breeds from a table that lists all dog breeds and their size,
then breed would be inserted into the dog table as a foreign key. This would allow easier searching as users can
mistype.
